# Extract-Stock-Sentiment-From-News-Headlines
Using news headlines of FB and TSLA we predict the sentiment using NLP sentiment analysis to generate investment insight.

### Project Description
In this project, we generate investing insight by applying sentiment analysis on financial news headlines from Finviz. Using this natural language processing technique, we get to interpret the emotion behind the headlines and predict whether the market feels good or bad about a stock.
